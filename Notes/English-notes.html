                        <h2>Getting started</h2>
                        <p>The image on page 9 displays four pictures
                            representing current issues:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The top-left picture shows a human face
                                interacting with a robotic hand, symbolizing the
                                rise of <strong>Artificial Intelligence
                                    (AI)</strong> and robotics.</li>
                            <li>The top-right picture depicts a barren, cracked
                                earth transforming into a lush green one held in
                                a hand, representing <strong>environmental
                                    issues</strong> like climate change and the
                                hope for a sustainable future.</li>
                            <li>The bottom-left picture shows a person
                                overwhelmed by various social media logos
                                (Pinterest, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter,
                                Instagram, YouTube), highlighting the impact and
                                potential issues of <strong>social
                                    media</strong>.</li>
                            <li>The bottom-right picture shows multiple hands
                                cupped together, holding a small amount of
                                grain, which can represent <strong>global
                                    hunger, poverty, or resource
                                    scarcity</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Reading I</h2>
                        <p><strong>Answer the following questions.</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>a. What do you know about artificial
                                        intelligence (AI)?</strong> Artificial
                                    intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation
                                    of human intelligence in machines that are
                                    programmed to think like humans and mimic
                                    their actions. It can involve capabilities
                                    like learning, problem-solving, and
                                    decision-making. As an example from the
                                    lesson, driverless cars use AI to navigate
                                    and operate.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p><strong>b. How do you think AI has changed
                                        the world?</strong> AI has significantly
                                    changed the world by automating tasks,
                                    transforming industries, and altering how we
                                    interact with technology. For instance, the
                                    development of driverless technology, as
                                    discussed in the reading, has the potential
                                    to revolutionize commuting, improve safety,
                                    and make cities more sustainable.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                                        Why?</strong> The text suggests that
                                    driverless technology <em>has the
                                        potential</em> to be safer than
                                    human-controlled driving. The World Health
                                    Organization estimates over 1.3 million
                                    deaths annually from road traffic crashes,
                                    and Camilla Fowler states that automation
                                    could provide safer roads and fewer
                                    fatalities. However, the text also
                                    highlights that for this to be achieved,
                                    driverless cars must be able to cope with
                                    the unpredictable nature of human drivers
                                    and complex road environments. So, while the
                                    goal is increased safety, it's still a

                        <h3>The Double-Edged Sword: Navigating the Challenges of
                            AI Advancement</h3>
                        <p><strong>By [Your Name/A Staff Reporter]</strong></p>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming
                            our world, promising unprecedented efficiency and
                            innovation, from the way we commute to how
                            industries operate. The allure of technologies like
                            driverless cars, which can navigate our streets with
                            sophisticated sensors and algorithms, is undeniable.
                            However, as AI systems become increasingly
                            integrated into the fabric of our society, they
                            bring a host of complex challenges that demand our
                            urgent attention. While AI offers solutions to many
                            existing problems, its advancement is a double-edged
                            sword, presenting new hurdles we must overcome to
                            ensure a beneficial and equitable future.</p>

                        <p>One of the most immediate concerns is the potential
                            for widespread job displacement. As AI-powered
                            machines and software become capable of performing
                            tasks previously done by humans – from driving
                            vehicles to complex data analysis – many fear for
                            their livelihoods. The dream of a
                            "calm and serene way of getting from A to B" in a
                            driverless vehicle might also mean a future with
                            fewer employment opportunities for human drivers.
                            This technological shift necessitates proactive
                            strategies for reskilling and upskilling the
                            workforce, alongside a broader societal conversation
                            about the future of work itself.</p>

                        <p>Safety and security in an AI-driven world also
                            present significant challenges. For AI systems like
                            driverless cars to become mainstream, they must
                            "operate safely and effectively in complex and unpredictable human environments".
                            This is a monumental task, as these systems need to
                            cope with variables like "human drivers speeding" or
                            breaking road rules. Beyond physical safety, the
                            risk of malicious attacks or inherent biases in AI
                            algorithms leading to unfair or harmful outcomes is
                            a growing concern. Ensuring that AI is not only
                            intelligent but also robust, secure, and ethically
                            sound is paramount.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, the question of liability and
                            responsibility in the age of AI is a complex legal
                            and ethical minefield. As Richard Jinks from
                            Oxbotica highlighted, the insurance industry is
                            already grappling with the shift
                            "from a person being responsible and in charge to the vehicle doing that".
                            When an autonomous system makes an error, who is to
                            blame? The programmer, the manufacturer, the owner,
                            or the AI itself? Establishing clear regulatory
                            frameworks and ethical guidelines is crucial to
                            address these issues of accountability and ensure
                            that the deployment of AI does not erode human
                            responsibility.</p>

                        <p>The challenge also extends to public perception and
                            trust. For technologies like driverless vehicles to
                            be widely accepted, extensive testing and
                            transparent communication about their capabilities
                            and limitations are essential. Building this trust
                            requires addressing not only the technological
                            hurdles but also the societal anxieties surrounding
                            AI. Moreover, the significant infrastructure changes
                            and regulatory updates needed to support widespread
                            AI adoption, as alluded to in the context of
                            driverless technology, represent substantial
                            logistical and financial challenges for governments
                            and industries alike.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, while the advancement of AI in
                            technology opens doors to a more efficient and
                            potentially safer future, it is imperative that we
                            approach these innovations with a clear
                            understanding of the accompanying challenges.
                            Addressing concerns related to job displacement,
                            ensuring robust safety and security measures,
                            establishing ethical and legal frameworks for
                            responsibility, and fostering public trust are
                            critical steps. Only by proactively and thoughtfully
                            navigating these complexities can we hope to harness
                            the full potential of AI for the betterment of
                            society, ensuring that this powerful technology

                                        intelligence (AI)?</strong> Artificial
                                    intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation
                                    of human intelligence in machines that are
                                    programmed to think like humans and mimic
                                    their actions. It can involve capabilities
                                    like learning, problem-solving, and
                                    decision-making. As an example from the
                                    lesson, driverless cars use AI to navigate
                                    and operate.</p>

                                        the world?</strong> AI has significantly
                                    changed the world by automating tasks,
                                    transforming industries, and altering how we
                                    interact with technology. For instance, the
                                    development of driverless technology, as
                                    discussed in the reading, has the potential
                                    to revolutionize commuting, improve safety,
                                    and make cities more sustainable.</p>

                                        Why?</strong> The text suggests that
                                    driverless technology <em>has the
                                        potential</em> to be safer than
                                    human-controlled driving. The World Health
                                    Organization estimates over 1.3 million
                                    deaths annually from road traffic crashes,
                                    and Camilla Fowler states that automation
                                    could provide safer roads and fewer
                                    fatalities. However, the text also
                                    highlights that for this to be achieved,
                                    driverless cars must be able to cope with
                                    the unpredictable nature of human drivers
                                    and complex road environments. So, while the
                                    goal is increased safety, it's still a

                        <h3>The Double-Edged Sword: Navigating the Challenges of
                            AI Advancement</h3>
                        <p><strong>By [Your Name/A Staff Reporter]</strong></p>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming
                            our world, promising unprecedented efficiency and
                            innovation, from the way we commute to how
                            industries operate. The allure of technologies like
                            driverless cars, which can navigate our streets with
                            sophisticated sensors and algorithms, is undeniable.
                            However, as AI systems become increasingly
                            integrated into the fabric of our society, they
                            bring a host of complex challenges that demand our
                            urgent attention. While AI offers solutions to many
                            existing problems, its advancement is a double-edged
                            sword, presenting new hurdles we must overcome to
                            ensure a beneficial and equitable future.</p>

                        <p>One of the most immediate concerns is the potential
                            for widespread job displacement. As AI-powered
                            machines and software become capable of performing
                            tasks previously done by humans – from driving
                            vehicles to complex data analysis – many fear for
                            their livelihoods. The dream of a
                            "calm and serene way of getting from A to B" in a
                            driverless vehicle might also mean a future with
                            fewer employment opportunities for human drivers.
                            This technological shift necessitates proactive
                            strategies for reskilling and upskilling the
                            workforce, alongside a broader societal conversation
                            about the future of work itself.</p>

                        <p>Safety and security in an AI-driven world also
                            present significant challenges. For AI systems like
                            driverless cars to become mainstream, they must
                            "operate safely and effectively in complex and unpredictable human environments".
                            This is a monumental task, as these systems need to
                            cope with variables like "human drivers speeding" or
                            breaking road rules. Beyond physical safety, the
                            risk of malicious attacks or inherent biases in AI
                            algorithms leading to unfair or harmful outcomes is
                            a growing concern. Ensuring that AI is not only
                            intelligent but also robust, secure, and ethically
                            sound is paramount.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, the question of liability and
                            responsibility in the age of AI is a complex legal
                            and ethical minefield. As Richard Jinks from
                            Oxbotica highlighted, the insurance industry is
                            already grappling with the shift
                            "from a person being responsible and in charge to the vehicle doing that".
                            When an autonomous system makes an error, who is to
                            blame? The programmer, the manufacturer, the owner,
                            or the AI itself? Establishing clear regulatory
                            frameworks and ethical guidelines is crucial to
                            address these issues of accountability and ensure
                            that the deployment of AI does not erode human
                            responsibility.</p>

                        <p>The challenge also extends to public perception and
                            trust. For technologies like driverless vehicles to
                            be widely accepted, extensive testing and
                            transparent communication about their capabilities
                            and limitations are essential. Building this trust
                            requires addressing not only the technological
                            hurdles but also the societal anxieties surrounding
                            AI. Moreover, the significant infrastructure changes
                            and regulatory updates needed to support widespread
                            AI adoption, as alluded to in the context of
                            driverless technology, represent substantial
                            logistical and financial challenges for governments
                            and industries alike.</p>

                        <p>In conclusion, while the advancement of AI in
                            technology opens doors to a more efficient and
                            potentially safer future, it is imperative that we
                            approach these innovations with a clear
                            understanding of the accompanying challenges.
                            Addressing concerns related to job displacement,
                            ensuring robust safety and security measures,
                            establishing ethical and legal frameworks for
                            responsibility, and fostering public trust are
                            critical steps. Only by proactively and thoughtfully
                            navigating these complexities can we hope to harness
                            the full potential of AI for the betterment of
                            society, ensuring that this powerful technology
                            serves humanity as a whole.</p>
